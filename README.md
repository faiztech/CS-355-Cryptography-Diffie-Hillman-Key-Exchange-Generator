Diffie Hillman Key Exchange is a public key algorithm.
For more on DH key Exchange read: CS-355-Cryptography-Diffie-Hillman-Key-Exchange-Generator/Diffie-Hillman-Explanation.txt

This project is a simple implementation of the working of the Algorithm.
By default it generates 100 keys (can be easily modified) and gives you a study of their occurences.


Note: This project is only for educational purposes. 
Please do not use the keys generated for actual encryption.
